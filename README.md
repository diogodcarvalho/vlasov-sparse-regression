# vlasov-sparse-regression

This repository contains the code developed for the Statistical Learning 2022/2023 Course (IST) on the topic:

_"Sparse regression for the recovery of nonlinear dynamics: SINDy, thoughts on correlated variables and optimization algorithms"_

The Jupyter notebook provides an overview of common sparse regression methods and uses as a test case the discovery of the Vlasov equation from Particle-In-Cell (PIC) plasma physics simulations.

Code is adapted from the E. P. Alves repository: https://github.com/epalves/data-driven-plasma/tree/main
